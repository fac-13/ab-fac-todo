# The AB-FAC Team To-Do List Project

We aimed to build a basic To-do app using DOM manipulation techniques and unit testing or TDD for client-side code.

This project is split into three parts:

1.  We used TDD to create the logic needed to modify our to-do list - all tests are stored in the test.js file
2.  Render the to-do list to the DOM
3.  Add a couple of unique features

### The project

- The project is based on the pre-built To-do list project of FAC shared on GitHub. 
- Tests were conducted using the npm `tape` module.

### User stories:

As a disorganised person I want to:

-   enter tasks I need to do into a web page so that I don't forget them
-   view the tasks I have added in a list so that I can plan my day
-   mark tasks as complete so that I can focus on the tasks I have left
-   the to-dos to be large enough so that I don't hit the wrong one with my thumb
-   click on any part of a to-do to mark it as complete so that it's easier for me to check to-dos off
